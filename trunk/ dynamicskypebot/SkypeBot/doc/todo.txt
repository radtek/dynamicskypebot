	The Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, literally meaning "cat-foot black-and-white") is a mammal native to central-western 
	and south western China. The Giant Panda is a member of the Ursidae (bear) family. It is easily recognized by its large,
	distinctive black patches around the eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora,
	the Giant Panda's diet is 99% bamboo. Other parts of its diet include honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges,
	and bananas when available.
